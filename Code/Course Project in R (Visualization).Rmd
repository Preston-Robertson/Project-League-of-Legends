## Does giving a good player the tools to succeed help their chances of winning the game?


## According to these graphs, it would appear yes, depending on the role you are playing. If the player is in the jungle position, then giving the players with a higher win rate more gold increases the chances of winning the game. This shows a great deal of player agency. The support role it does not matter the win-rate of the player, but does correlate with the amount of gold earned. This shows some agency; however, it does show that the role is strong if players that typically lose games can win if given some gold. The ADC shows no correlation with either, the shows this role has no agency on the game.

# Does the speed at which gold is earned and kills are made have an impact on the game?

# Arguably these stats seems to have the highest impact on a win, if they are both high values. Later in the ML section you will see that it does not have an impact if separated. These stats further cement the previously stated points of ADC role is weaker since the correlation is not as strong. Jungle is most the ideal role from a balance persepctive and Support seems to be a little too strong right now.

## Player agency is an important topic in the world of video game design. Not only do you want your players to feel like they can accomplish something but also for game balance. 
## The game is balanced around individual players, so each individual player's agency is very important.
## For example, if I said a golf player scored a 10 you would naturally think that golfer did poorly, but with the context that par is 27. Then you would assume they are very good.
## If a player only has around 2-3% agency on the game, then if an item/champion has a win rate around 56% it is a huge deal.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
